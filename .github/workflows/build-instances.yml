# The following workflow was designed in an attempt to be idempotent as to not 
# waste storage space. Order of execution is also important, as the following 
# steps will run sequentially every time.

# When main branch is updated via direct push or PR, use packwiz to create a 
# new Curseforge instance, Modrinth instance, and a Prism instance (which will
# include a bundled packwiz-installer-bootstrap.jar), and upload as a build 
# artifact. Do not compile packwiz from source, just fetch the latest
# successful Go build from their repository.
